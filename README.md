### Description
Prendo, short for the latin word for "check", *reprehendo*, is an iOS-based to-do list app built around the idea that keeping track of your deadlines and activities should not be a chore. With a minimalistic approach to the user interface, Prendo aims to take the work out of keeping track of your everyday tasks.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** Mobile first experience will allow users to easily check in on tasks and their progress. The initial application will use the camera and location with future plans to incorporate other mobile-focused aspects.
- **Story:** User is presented all notes and activities at the homescreen. The ability to create a new task will be present. This simple usage flow will encourage active planning for all engagements and helps users develop healthy habits towards everyday tasks or future activities.
- **Market:** Anyone who needs to keep track of a busy schedule can use the app, so from executives engaged in multiple meetings to homework emboiled college students and occupied soccer moms.
- **Habit:** Users can set tasks for any time at any time, tasks for the same day or many months ahead. This allows for a wide scope of repeated use of the app.
- **Scope:** Version 1 will begin as a to-do list. Version 2 will expand to have habit tracking/reporting features. Version 3 will look at integrating social media features where users can post stories about completed tasks and healthy habit streaks on their timelines.
